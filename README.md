# Game #7
Based on [3D 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-3d/).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://thereal2048.github.io/game7/)

## Changes from regular 3D 2048 game
* regular tiles now look like special tiles
* 3D 3x3x3 grid
* More special tiles

### Special tiles

There are 11 'bonus' tiles, '2', '4', '8', '16', '32', '64', '128', '256', '512', '1024', and '2048'. The 'regular' tiles have same colors from special tiles and can get really confusing. For special tiles: Both tiles will disappear after being merged.

It's not a really bonus tile. I made this just to increase more difficulty. Since the confusing version has 3d directions, it's much harder than the normal version of 3d 2048 if there's no traverse. Do you have any good idea?

## How to play

Use your arrow keys to move the tiles, R(or Q) and F(or E) to move ahead and back, any useless letter key to rotate, hold 1, 2 or 3 to hide layers, ESC and 0 to restart. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.
